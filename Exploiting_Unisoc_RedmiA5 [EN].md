# Root Redmi A5 4G (GLOBAL)
### ‼️ DISCLAIMER
**I'm not responsible for any damage, follow this procedure at your own risk**

## Preface
the **Redmi A5** is an entry-level smartphone released in March 2025, based on Android 15 Go Edition. it is powered by a Unisoc T7250 processor and comes with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.

for a few months, I did a lot of research trying to find a way to unlock the Bootloader and gain root access. browsing some posts on **XDA Developers**, I discovered that the **T7250** chipset is vulnerable to **CVE-2022-38694**, a flaw that allows code execution with **BootROM** privileges. knowing this, I decided to take the risk and perform the unlock procedure on my **Redmi A5**.


## Requisites
Windows OS.\
SPD and WinUSB/LibUSB drivers.

## First step

you must enable Developer Mode and keep the options "USB Debugging" and "OEM Unlock" turned on.
after following this procedure, you must put your cellphone into **preloader** mode (the mode in which the device starts before the operating system, low level).

to enter Preloader mode, you must turn off your device and then press the volume down (-) button + power button until your computer recognizes it in the Windows Device Manager.

## Second step
having completed the first step, you should now download the exploit for the processor. (Unisoc):\
