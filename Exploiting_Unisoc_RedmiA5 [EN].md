# Root Redmi A5 4G (GLOBAL)
### ‼️ DISCLAIMER
**I'm not responsible for any damage, follow this procedure at your own risk**

## Preface
the **Redmi A5** is an entry-level smartphone released in March 2025, based on Android 15 Go Edition. it is powered by a Unisoc T7250 processor and comes with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.

for a few months, I did a lot of research trying to find a way to unlock the Bootloader and gain root access. browsing some posts on **XDA Developers**, I discovered that the **T7250** chipset is vulnerable to **CVE-2022-38694**, a flaw that allows code execution with **BootROM** privileges. knowing this, I decided to take the risk and perform the unlock procedure on my **Redmi A5**.


## Requisites
Windows OS.\
SPD and WinUSB/LibUSB drivers.
- [SPD_Driver](https://androiddatahost.com/dsa6h)
- [Zadig](https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi/releases)

## First step

you must enable Developer Mode and keep the options "USB Debugging" and "OEM Unlock" turned on.
after following this procedure, you must put your cellphone into **preloader** mode (the mode in which the device starts before the operating system, low level).

to enter Preloader mode, you must turn off your device and then press the volume down (-) button + power button until your computer recognizes it in the Windows Device Manager.

## Second step
having completed the first step, you should now download the exploit for the processor. (Unisoc):\
[DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/TomKing062/CVE-2022-38694_unlock_bootloader/releases/download/1.72/ums9230e_Tecno_KL4.zip)

## Third step
with the exploit in hand, you must connect your smartphone to your computer via USB, run the ```unlock_autopatch_9230.bat``` file and wait until the process is done.
your device is expected to reboot a few times, and once the process is complete, an unlocked padlock should appear on the boot logo. (means it was succesfully unlocked).

#### ⚠️ (THIS WILL DELETE ALL DATA) in case of a brick, create a ```fix.bat``` file in the same folder as the exploit, and paste the following content into the file.
```batch
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion

spd_dump exec_addr 0x65015f08 fdl fdl1-dl.bin 0x65000800 fdl fdl2-dl.bin 0x9efffe00 exec r boot w splloader splloader.bin w uboot uboot.bin  w misc misc-wipe.bin reset

pause
```
repeat the process to enter preloader mode and run ```fix.bat```.
